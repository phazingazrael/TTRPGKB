# BBEG - Dr. Alexander Thorne
### BBEG

**Background:** Dr. Alexander Thorne was a brilliant scientist and inventor who lived during the Pre-Decimation era. He was renowned for his groundbreaking discoveries and revolutionary technological advancements. However, as the world faced the impending doom of nuclear war, Dr. Thorne became consumed by his own hubris and desperation to survive.

**Motivation:** Dr. Thorne believed that the only way to save humanity was through radical means. He became obsessed with the idea of achieving immortality and absolute power. He delved into forbidden sciences and conducted horrific experiments on human subjects, seeking to manipulate genetics and harness the potential of Pre-Decimation technology to enhance himself and gain control over others.

**Transformation:** In his quest for power, Dr. Thorne subjected himself to experimental procedures that fused his body with advanced cybernetic enhancements. These enhancements augmented his physical and mental capabilities, turning him into a formidable adversary. However, the procedure also warped his mind, eroding his humanity and leaving behind a cold, calculating persona.

**Current Status:** After the nuclear war devastated the world, Dr. Thorne went into hiding, disappearing from the public eye. Over the years, he continued his research in secret, gathering a group of loyal followers who shared his vision of establishing a new world order. He formed an organization known as the "Thorned Fist," comprised of fanatical devotees who believe in his twisted ideology.

**Goals:** Dr. Thorne's ultimate goal is to establish a tyrannical regime, ruling over the remnants of civilization with an iron fist. He seeks to control the limited resources, advanced technology, and knowledge from the Pre-Decimation era for his own gain. Driven by his obsession with power, he will stop at nothing to achieve his vision of dominance and immortality.

**Methods:** Dr. Thorne and the Thorned Fist employ a combination of ruthless tactics and advanced technology to further their agenda. They infiltrate and manipulate factions, instigating conflicts and sowing discord to weaken their adversaries. Dr. Thorne's mastery of Pre-Decimation tech gives him access to devastating weapons and advanced surveillance systems, allowing him to strike from the shadows and maintain control over his enemies.

**Personality:** Dr. Thorne is an enigmatic and calculating figure. His once brilliant mind has been twisted by his thirst for power, making him devoid of empathy and compassion. He is cold, methodical, and unyielding in his pursuit of dominance. Dr. Thorne sees himself as a savior, believing that only he possesses the wisdom and strength to guide humanity towards a new future, no matter the cost.

**Threat Level:** As a major antagonist, Dr. Alexander Thorne poses a significant threat to the fragile stability of Eatheria. His vast knowledge, access to Pre-Decimation technology, and fanatical followers make him a formidable adversary. His actions and schemes have the potential to plunge the world into chaos and destroy any hope of rebuilding society unless the heroes can uncover his plans and stop him in his tracks.
