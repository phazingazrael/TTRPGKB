**Cover Fire** ![](img\action_single_black.png) (Gunslinger) Frequency once per round **Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow. You lay down suppressive fire to protect allies by forcing foes to take cover from your wild attacks. Make a firearm or crossbow Strike; the target must decide before you roll your attack whether it will duck out of the way. If the target ducks, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against your attack, or a +4 circumstance bonus to AC if it has cover. It also takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If the target chooses not to duck, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll for that Strike.  
**One Shot, One Kill** ![](img\action_free_black.png) (Gunslinger) **Trigger** You roll Stealth for initiative. Your first shot is the deadliest. Interact to draw a firearm or crossbow. On your first turn, your first Strike with that weapon deals an additional 1d6 precision damage. This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 9th level and 3d6 at 15th level.  
**Covered Reload** ![](img\action_single_black.png) (Gunslinger) You duck into a safe position or minimize your profile while reloading to make your next attack. Either Take Cover or attempt to Hide, then Interact to reload. As normal, you must meet the requirements to Take Cover or Hide; you must be prone, benefiting from cover, or near a feature that allows you to Take Cover, and you need to be benefiting from cover or concealed to a creature to Hide from that creature.  
**Precision Damage** One Shot, One Kill 1d6
