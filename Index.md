# Eatheria

Eatheria is a post-apocalyptic world that has emerged from the ashes of a devastating nuclear war. It is a realm where remnants of the Pre-Decimation era mingle with the fantastical and extraordinary. Shattered landscapes, mutated creatures, and the ruins of once-great civilizations are scattered throughout the land, serving as constant reminders of the cataclysmic events that reshaped the world.

## Nations and Territories:
Eatheria is divided into ten distinct nations, each with its own history, culture, and struggles. These nations are Berdia, Chaves, Gande, Garland, Kovamstan, Menut, Pithudia, Qajaria, Tarda, and Topoco. Each nation represents a unique blend of races, customs, and ideologies, forming a patchwork of diverse societies within the post-apocalyptic world. They vie for resources, power, and influence, shaping the landscape of Eatheria.

## Fantastical Races
In the wake of the nuclear war, humanity and various animal species evolved and adapted to the harsh environment, giving rise to a multitude of fantastical races. Alongside humans, creatures such as dwarves, elves, orcs, and hybrid beings coexist, each with their own distinct abilities, strengths, and cultures. These races have formed alliances, rivalries, and communities as they navigate the challenges of the new world.

## Technology and Magic
Eatheria is a realm where remnants of advanced Pre-Decimation technology coexist with primal forces of magic. While some pockets of Pre-Decimation technology have survived and are still functional, most of the world relies on more rudimentary means of survival. Magic, once a rare and mystical force, has become more prevalent in the aftermath of the nuclear war. Mages, spellcasters, and individuals with innate magical abilities wield their powers to shape reality, defend their nations, and unravel the mysteries of the past.

## Ruins and Wastelands
The landscape of Eatheria is characterized by ruins and wastelands, bearing the scars of the nuclear conflict. Crumbling cities, decaying infrastructure, and toxic landscapes are remnants of the Pre-Decimation era. Within these ruins, hidden treasures, dangerous secrets, and remnants of lost knowledge await those brave enough to venture into the desolate and forgotten corners of the world.

## Survival and Conflict
Survival is a constant struggle in Eatheria. Scarce resources, hostile creatures, and rival factions seeking dominance make everyday life a precarious endeavor. Nations compete for control over territories and resources, leading to alliances, trade agreements, and frequent conflicts. The world is a dangerous place, and individuals must navigate treacherous landscapes, make difficult choices, and forge alliances to ensure their survival.

## Journey of Rediscovery
Eatheria is a world in the process of rediscovery. The remnants of the past hold hidden knowledge, forgotten technologies, and the potential for both salvation and destruction. Scholars, adventurers, and seekers of truth strive to uncover the mysteries of the Pre-Decimation era, seeking answers that may shape the future of Eatheria. The world is ripe with opportunities for exploration, adventure, and the unearthing of forgotten histories.

As the inhabitants of Eatheria strive to rebuild, survive, and carve out their place in this new world, they face the challenges of a shattered civilization and the promise of hope amidst the ruins. The fate of Eatheria rests in the hands of its inhabitants, who must navigate the complexities of their new reality while confronting the shadows of their past.
