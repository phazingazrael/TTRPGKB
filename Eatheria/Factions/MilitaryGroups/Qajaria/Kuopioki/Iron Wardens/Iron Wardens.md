**Overview:** 
The Iron Wardens are a stalwart faction dedicated to the protection and security of Qajaria. Emerging from the remnants of survivors who sought to rebuild and safeguard their community after the devastating nuclear war, they have a deep sense of responsibility to protect Kuopioki and its inhabitants.

**Description:** 
The Iron Wardens operate with a strong sense of duty and discipline. They are driven by the desire to maintain law and order within Qajaria and to ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens. The faction's origins lie in the early days of the post-apocalyptic world when a group of determined individuals came together to protect their community from the dangers that surrounded them.

In their signature iron armor, the Wardens are a symbol of authority and stability. They have enacted a city-wide law restricting the open carry of any weaponry, both melee and ranged, in order to prevent unnecessary conflicts and maintain a semblance of peace within Qajaria. This law is enforced rigorously, ensuring that the citizens can go about their lives without fear.

The Iron Wardens' headquarters is a fortified structure located in the heart of Qajaria. From this central hub, they coordinate patrols, respond to threats, and administer justice. They have a hierarchical leadership structure, with Captain Valeria at the helm, overseeing the faction's operations and ensuring the smooth running of the city.

The Wardens are respected by the inhabitants of Qajaria for their dedication and unwavering commitment to the city's safety. They are known to be skilled in combat, trained in law enforcement, and equipped with advanced technology salvaged from the post-apocalyptic world. Alongside their duty to protect the citizens, they also play a crucial role in upholding the city's traditions and preserving its history.

While the Iron Wardens are focused on maintaining order and security, their strict regulations have sparked some controversy. Some citizens argue that the open carry restriction infringes upon personal freedoms, while others appreciate the stability and security it brings. This tension can lead to occasional clashes of ideology and differing opinions within the community.
