**HP** 20  
**Shield Block** ![](img\action_reaction_black.png)**Trigger** While you have your shield raised, you would take damage from a physical attack. You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s Hardness. You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.  
**Liberating Step** ![](img\action_reaction_black.png)**Trigger** An enemy damages, Grabs, or Grapples your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you. You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn’t need to escape.

**Melee** Greatsword +7 (Versatile P), **Damage** 1d12+4 S  
**Melee** Dagger +7 (Agile, Finesse, Thrown 10 ft., Versatile S), **Damage** 1d4+4 P

**Focus Spells** (1 points) **Healer's Blessing** ![](img\action_single_black.png)**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 willing living creature **Duration** 1 minute Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points. The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once. **Heightened (+1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP.  
**Lay on Hands** ![](img\action_single_black.png)**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature Your hands become infused with positive energy, healing a living creature or damaging an undead creature with a touch. If you use _lay on hands_ on a willing living target, you restore 6 Hit Points; if the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC for 1 round. Against an undead target, you deal 1d6 damage and it must attempt a basic Fortitude save; if it fails, it also takes a -2 status penalty to AC for 1 round. **Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing increases by 6, and the damage to an undead target increases by 1d6.

Notes: who am? How did I get here? I don't have any pain or injuries so that can't be it. Well, who ever I am, I guess I really like tattoos. I am covered in them. They do give have some nifty tricks. This tattoo dagger on my right forearm is going to be handy. I wouldn't have noticed it if I didn't itch my arm and felt something solid under my skin. Come to find out I have a dagger attached to me. I can also feel some kind of static flowing in my hands. Sometimes the tattoos seems like they move, but that can't be right. I was lucky enough to come across an old farmer who took pity of my circumstances. Was provided a place to stay and work while I tried to piece together what happened to me. Nothing was coming to me other than the urge to press on. Maybe I can find answers out there. I was able to Scrounge enough coin from odd jobs and needed supplies to begin my journey. You have to start somewhere I guess, here we go. Black short hair Blue eyes Doesn't who he really is - uncertain
