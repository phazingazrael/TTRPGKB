**Shield Block** ![](attachment/540193e74673fe896622553509348e1a.png)**Trigger** While you have your shield raised, you would take damage from a physical attack. You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s Hardness. You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.

**Spellstrike** ![](attachment/e3616dd6f9957eeddc9ebeee1a0c455a.png) (Magus) **Frequency** until recharged (see below). You channel a spell into a punch or sword thrust to deliver a combined attack. You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don’t occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed the Spellstrike. The infusion of spell energy grants your Strike the arcane trait, making it magical. After you use Spellstrike, you can’t do so again until you recharge your Spellstrike as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You also recharge your Spellstrike when you cast a conflux spell (page 40) that takes at least 1 action to cast; casting a focus spell of another type doesn’t recharge your Spellstrike.  
**Arcane Cascade** ![](attachment/dfabc894be1573a2f226e142a858db4a.png) (Concentrate, Magus, Stance) **Requirements** You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell or make a Spellstrike. . You divert a portion of the spell’s magical power and keep it cycling through your body and weapon using specialized forms, breathing, or footwork. While you’re in the stance, your melee Strikes deal 1 extra damage. This damage increases to 2 if you have weapon specialization and 3 if you have greater weapon specialization. Any Strike that benefits from this damage gains the arcane trait, making it magical. . If your most recent spell before entering the stance was one that can deal damage, the damage from the stance is the same type that spell could deal (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage). If the spell couldn’t deal damage, this stance’s bonus damage depends on the spell’s school. Abjuration or Evocation force; Conjuration or Transmutation same type as your weapon or unarmed attack ; Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion mental; Necromancy negative;

**Focus Spells** (1 points) **Shielding Strike** ![](attachment/dfabc894be1573a2f226e142a858db4a.png)As you attack a foe, warding magic transforms your momentum into action and lifts your shield. Make a melee Strike. You can then either Raise your Shield if you're wielding one or cast shield if you have the spell.
