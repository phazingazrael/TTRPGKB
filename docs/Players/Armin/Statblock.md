    desc: "⬲ **Prerequisites** trained in Nature **Frequency** once per hour **Trigger** A creature with the animal, beast, elemental, fey, fungus, or plant trait attacks you, and you can see the attacker. Your canny understanding of natural and primal creatures helps you predict and dodge their attacks. The triggering attack roll targets your Nature DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being flat-footed, even though you wouldn’t take the –2 circumstance penalty against the attack."
  - name: "Toxic Skin"
    desc: "⬲ **Frequency** once per hour **Trigger** A creature touches you, such as by Grappling you, successfully hitting you with an unarmed attack, or using a touch-range spell against you. You exude a deadly toxin. The triggering creature takes 1d4 poison damage (basic Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4."
