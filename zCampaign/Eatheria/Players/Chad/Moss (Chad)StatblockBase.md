**Sudden Charge** ![](img\action_double_black.png) (Flourish, Open) With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.  
**Rage** ![](img\action_single_black.png) (Barbarian, Concentrate, Emotion, Mental) **Requirements** You aren’t fatigued or raging. You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can’t voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging: You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile. ; You take a –1 penalty to AC. ; You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.; After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can’t Rage again for 1 minute.
