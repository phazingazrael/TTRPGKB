# House Rules
## House Rule - Special Roll: Epic Destiny Die

Description: In your campaign, there is a special d20 called the Epic Destiny Die. Once per gaming session, any player may choose to roll this d20 without applying any of their regular bonuses. The Epic Destiny Die brings forth the potential for extraordinary outcomes, both in favor of the player and against them.

Details:

1. Activation: At any point during a gaming session, a player can announce their intention to use the Epic Destiny Die for their next d20 roll.
    
2. No Regular Bonuses: When rolling the Epic Destiny Die, the player does not add any of their regular bonuses, such as ability modifiers, proficiency bonuses, or other situational bonuses. Only the result of the d20 is considered.
    
3. Doubling and Halving: After rolling the Epic Destiny Die, the result is evaluated. If the result falls between 11 and 20 (inclusive), the result is doubled. If the result falls between 1 and 10 (inclusive), the result is halved. Any fractions resulting from halving are rounded down.
    
4. Example: Let's say a player uses the Epic Destiny Die and rolls a 14. Since 14 falls between 11 and 20, the result is doubled to 28. However, if they rolled a 6, which falls between 1 and 10, the result would be halved to 3.
    
5. Limitation: The Epic Destiny Die can only be used once per gaming session. Once it has been used, it cannot be used again until the next gaming session.


## House Rule: Consumable Ammunition and Arrows

Description: In this campaign, a house rule is implemented to streamline the tracking of basic ammunition and arrows. Instead of meticulously keeping track of each individual shot or arrow, players will be responsible for purchasing a reasonable supply of ammunition and arrows, and replenishing their stock within a reasonable timeframe based on their usage.

Details:

1. Reasonable Supply: At the start of the adventure or when acquiring a ranged weapon, each player should purchase a reasonable supply of basic ammunition or arrows. The quantity of this initial supply can be determined by the Game Master (GM) based on the player's class, level, and the availability of resources within the game world.
    
2. Usage Tracking: During gameplay, players do not need to track each individual shot or arrow fired. Instead, they should keep a mental note of their overall usage.
    
3. Replenishment Requirement: Within a reasonable amount of gameplay, typically after a significant combat encounter or a few sessions, players are expected to replenish their ammunition and arrow supply by purchasing more. The exact timing can be determined by the GM based on the pacing of the campaign.
    
4. Resource Management: Players are responsible for managing their ammunition and arrow supply responsibly. Excessive or unrealistic usage without replenishment may result in scarcity penalties imposed by the GM, such as a temporary shortage of ammunition or limited availability in shops.
    
5. Special and Rare Ammunition: This house rule primarily applies to basic ammunition and arrows. Special or rare ammunition with unique properties or limited availability, such as magical arrows or alchemical bullets, should still be tracked individually.

## House Rule: Heroic Recovery

Description: The Heroic Recovery house rule provides players with an opportunity to make a last-ditch effort and cheat death when their character drops to 0 hit points but doesn't die outright. It allows for thrilling moments of heroic comebacks and adds an extra layer of tension and excitement to combat encounters.

Details:

1. Activation: The Heroic Recovery house rule can be used when a player's character reaches 0 hit points but doesn't instantly die from the damage they have taken.
    
2. Saving Throw: The player whose character is at 0 hit points must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The DC can be adjusted based on the difficulty of the encounter or the severity of the character's injuries.
    
3. Success: If the player succeeds on the saving throw, their character stabilizes and regains 1 hit point. This allows the character to continue participating in the battle, albeit with limited health.
    
4. Failure: If the player fails the saving throw, their character remains unconscious and continues to make death saving throws as per the regular rules.
    
5. Usage Limit: The Heroic Recovery house rule can only be attempted once every 2 weeks of in-game time. This represents the character's need for sufficient rest and recovery before they can tap into their inner reserves again.
    
6. Narrative Description: The GM and the player can work together to describe the dramatic moment of the character's heroic recovery. This can involve displaying unwavering resolve, tapping into hidden reserves of inner strength, or sheer luck that defies the odds.
